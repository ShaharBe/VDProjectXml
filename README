This is a simple .NET command line application that will convert a VDPROJ file into an XML structure.
That structure can then easily be manipulated and/or modified. For example, changing the installer
version number, product name, icon, etc. Then XML structure can then, just as easily, be converted
back to a VDPROJ file. This is a bit easier than using regular expressions to parse the VDPROJ file.

The resulting XML is a fairly direct representation of the VDPROJ file. Each node in the VDPROJ is
converted to an XML element. Invalid element name characters are encoded according to
System.Xml.XmlConvert.EncodeLocalName.

The code is very simple. There is no license. You are free to use and abuse it as you see fit.
